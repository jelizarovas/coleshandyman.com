        As a kid I found enjoyment from fixing things others saw as broken. I took this passion with me and I started
        handyman work right out of high school in 1978. I’ve been a licensed contractor since then and plan to keep
        going for years to come. My mission is to help people in need. I’m community focused and driven to do the best
        quality work for everyone. My work is lifetime guaranteed and there is no job to big or too small. We do work
        for local judges, attorneys, professional athletes and more. Please take a look at our gallery.
